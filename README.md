## <ins> Description of the Task: </ins>

The requested task for this assignment was to create a portfolio for ourselves, the developer with information about ourselves and our current work. The portfolio is to be updated and improved as completed projects go on to showcase current skillsets. 

## <ins> Description of the Page: </ins>

What is the purpose of the page? This portfolio page is about me, Maung Htike. It acts as like a digital portfolio of my current programming experience and can be used by interested parties to learn more about me and my work from a professional viewpoint.

## <ins> Remarks: </ins>

I have added numerous comments along both the index.html and style.css files to annotate what a specific part of the code does. Comments on index.html shows where the important elements and sections of the page are. Comments on style.css shows what is being selected and what lines on index.html are being affected.

## <ins> Used Programs: </ins>

- VS Code
